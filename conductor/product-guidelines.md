# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic
The Pro Buddy application adheres to a **Calm & Organic** aesthetic. The UI uses soft colors, rounded corners, and a nature-inspired palette. This design choice aims to reduce user stress and promote a mindful, focused environment for productivity.

## Communication & Prose Style
- **Core Tone:** Supportive and gentle, acting as an encouraging mentor. The prose focuses on progress rather than perfection.
- **Goal Accountability:** While generally supportive, the AI becomes **direct and inquisitive** when the user deviates from their goals.
    - If phone usage is unusually low, the AI might ask: "I see you're barely on your phone; I'll assume you're going hard on your goals?"
    - If phone usage is unusually high, especially for users with offline or laptop-focused goals, the AI should probe: "Is everything okay? Your usage suggests you might be struggling to stay on track."
- **Feedback Loop:** The AI should always prioritize understanding the user's current situation before providing feedback.

## User Interface & Experience
- **Error Handling:** Errors are handled constructively. Instead of just reporting a failure, the app guides the user toward a solution.
- **Reporting:** A clear mechanism is provided for users to report bugs or technical issues directly to the development team.
- **Empty States:** When no data is available (e.g., no goals set), the UI provides clear, encouraging prompts to guide the user toward the next step.

## Branding & Colors
The primary brand identity is centered around **Forest Green and Teal**. These colors represent growth, balance, and the organic nature of personal development, complementing the overall "Calm & Organic" visual style.
